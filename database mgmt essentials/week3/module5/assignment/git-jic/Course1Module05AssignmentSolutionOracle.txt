SELECT eventrequest.eventno, dateheld, COUNT(*) "Number of Plans"
FROM eventrequest, eventplan
WHERE eventplan.workdate BETWEEN to_date('12/1/2013','mm/dd/yyyy') AND to_date('12/31/2013','mm/dd/yyyy')
      AND eventrequest.eventno = eventplan.eventno
GROUP BY eventrequest.eventno, dateheld
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

SELECT eventrequest.eventno, dateheld, COUNT(*) "Number of Plans"

4.	The first solution is preferred because it involves one less table. However, I will also give credit for the second answer as it involves different join operations.

SELECT eventplan.planno, lineno, locname, resname, numberfld, 
                timestart, timeend
FROM facility, eventplan, eventplanline, resourcetbl, location
WHERE eventplan.workdate BETWEEN to_date('10/1/2013','mm/dd/yyyy') AND to_date('12/31/2013','mm/dd/yyyy')
      AND eventplan.planno = eventplanline.planno AND location.facno = facility.facno
      AND facname = 'Basketball arena' AND eventplanline.resno = resourcetbl.resno
      AND location.locno = eventplanline.locno 
      AND eventplan.activity = 'Operation';

SELECT eventplan.planno, lineno, locname, resname, numberfld, timestart, timeend
FROM eventrequest, facility, eventplan, eventplanline, resourcetbl, location
WHERE eventplan.workdate BETWEEN to_date('10/1/2013','mm/dd/yyyy') AND to_date('12/31/2013','mm/dd/yyyy')
      AND eventplan.planno = eventplanline.planno AND eventrequest.facno = facility.facno
      AND facname = 'Basketball arena' AND eventplanline.resno = resourcetbl.resno
      AND eventrequest.eventno = eventplan.eventno 
      AND location.locno = eventplanline.locno 
      AND eventplan.activity = 'Operation';


Database Modification Answers

1.	
INSERT INTO Facility ( FacNo, FacName )
VALUES ('F107', 'Swimming Pool');

2.	
INSERT INTO Location ( LocNo, FacNo, LocName )
VALUES ('L107', 'F107', 'Door');

3.	
INSERT INTO Location ( LocNo, FacNo, LocName )
VALUES ('L108', 'F107', 'Locker Room');

4.	
UPDATE Location SET LocName = ‘Gate’
WHERE LocNo = 'L107'; 

5.
DELETE Location
WHERE LocNo = 'L108';
