SELECT eventrequest.eventno, dateheld, COUNT(*) "Number of Plans"
FROM eventrequest, eventplan
WHERE eventplan.workdate BETWEEN str_to_date('1,DEC,13','%d,%b,%y') AND str_to_date('31,DEC,13','%d,%b,%y')
      AND eventrequest.eventno = eventplan.eventno

4.	The first solution is preferred because it involves one less table. However, I will also give credit for the second answer as it involves different join operations.

SELECT eventplan.planno, lineno, locname, resname, numberfld, 
                timestart, timeend
FROM facility, eventplan, eventplanline, resourcetbl, location
WHERE eventplan.workdate BETWEEN str_to_date('1,JAN,13','%d,%b,%y') AND str_to_date('31,DEC,13','%d,%b,%y')
      AND eventplan.planno = eventplanline.planno AND location.facno = facility.facno
      AND facname = 'Basketball arena' AND eventplanline.resno = resourcetbl.resno
      AND location.locno = eventplanline.locno 
      AND eventplan.activity = 'Operation';

SELECT eventplan.planno, lineno, locname, resname, numberfld, timestart, timeend
FROM eventrequest, facility, eventplan, eventplanline, resourcetbl, location
WHERE eventplan.workdate BETWEEN str_to_date('1,JAN,13','%d,%b,%y') AND str_to_date('31,DEC,13','%d,%b,%y')
      AND eventplan.planno = eventplanline.planno AND eventrequest.facno = facility.facno
      AND facname = 'Basketball arena' AND eventplanline.resno = resourcetbl.resno
      AND eventrequest.eventno = eventplan.eventno 
      AND location.locno = eventplanline.locno 
      AND eventplan.activity = 'Operation';


Database Modification Answers

1.	
INSERT INTO Facility ( FacNo, FacName )
VALUES ('F107', 'Swimming Pool');

2.	
INSERT INTO Location ( LocNo, FacNo, LocName )
VALUES ('L107', 'F107', 'Gate');

3.	
INSERT INTO Location ( LocNo, FacNo, LocName )
VALUES ('L108', 'F107', 'Locker Room');

4.	
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
	
UPDATE Location SET LocName = ‘Gate’
WHERE LocNo = 'L107'; 

SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 1;

5.

DELETE Location
WHERE LocNo = 'L108';
