Query Formulation Answers

1.	The DISTINCT keyword is required here because the combination of city, state, and zip is not unique.

SELECT DISTINCT city, state, zip FROM CUSTOMER;

2.	The LIKE comparison operator is necessary when using a pattern matching symbol (%).  The string “3-%” matches any string beginning with “3-”.

SELECT empname, department, phone, email FROM employee
WHERE phone LIKE '3-%';

3.	

SELECT * FROM resourcetbl
WHERE rate BETWEEN 10 and 20
ORDER BY rate;

4.	This query can be formulated using the IN comparison operator or the logical OR.  You should use parentheses when mixing AND and OR operators.

SELECT eventno, dateauth, status

FROM eventrequest

WHERE dateauth BETWEEN str_to_date('1,JUL,13','%d,%b,%y') AND str_to_date('31,JUL,13','%d,%b,%y') 
      
	AND status IN ('Approved', 'Denied');

SELECT eventno, dateauth, status
FROM eventrequest
WHERE dateauth BETWEEN str_to_date('1,JUL,13','%d,%b,%y') AND str_to_date('31,JUL,13','%d,%b,%y') 
      AND (status = 'Approved' OR status = 'Denied');

5.	These solutions demonstrate the “cross product”, “join operator”, and Type I nested styles.

SELECT location.locno, locname
FROM facility, location
WHERE facname = 'Basketball arena' AND facility.facno = location.facno;

SELECT location.locno, locname
FROM facility INNER JOIN location ON facility.facno = location.facno
WHERE facname = 'Basketball arena';

SELECT location.locno, locname
FROM location
WHERE location.facno IN 
   ( SELECT facno FROM facility WHERE facname = 'Basketball arena' );


6.	The AS keywords are optional.  Aggregrate functions do not need to be renamed.

SELECT planno, COUNT(*) "Number of Lines", SUM(numberfld) "Resource Sum"
FROM eventplanline
GROUP BY planno;
