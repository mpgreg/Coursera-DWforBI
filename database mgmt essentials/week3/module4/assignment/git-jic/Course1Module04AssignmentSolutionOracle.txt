Query Formulation Answers

1.	The DISTINCT keyword is required here because the combination of city, state, and zip is not unique.

SELECT DISTINCT city, state, zip FROM CUSTOMER;

2.	The LIKE comparison operator is necessary when using a pattern matching symbol (%).  The string ì3-%î matches any string beginning with ì3-î.

SELECT empname, department, phone, email FROM employee
WHERE phone LIKE '3-%';

3.	

SELECT * FROM resourcetbl
WHERE rate BETWEEN 10 and 20
ORDER BY rate;

4.	This query can be formulated using the IN comparison operator or the logical OR.  You should use parentheses when mixing AND and OR operators.

SELECT eventno, dateauth, status
FROM eventrequest
WHERE dateauth BETWEEN to_date('7/1/2013','mm/dd/yyyy') AND to_date('7/31/2013','mm/dd/yyyy') 
      AND status IN ('Approved', 'Denied');

SELECT eventno, dateauth, status
FROM eventrequest
WHERE dateauth BETWEEN to_date('7/1/2013','mm/dd/yyyy') AND to_date('7/31/2013','mm/dd/yyyy') 
      AND (status = 'Approved' OR status = 'Denied');

5.	These solutions demonstrate the ìcross productî, ìjoin operatorî, and Type I nested styles.

SELECT location.locno, locname
FROM facility, location
WHERE facname = 'Basketball arena' AND facility.facno = location.facno;

SELECT location.locno, locname
FROM facility INNER JOIN location ON facility.facno = location.facno
WHERE facname = 'Basketball arena';

SELECT location.locno, locname
FROM location
WHERE location.facno IN 
   ( SELECT facno FROM facility WHERE facname = 'Basketball arena' );


6.	The AS keywords are optional.  Aggregrate functions do not need to be renamed.

SELECT planno, COUNT(*) "Number of Lines", SUM(numberfld) "Resource Sum"
FROM eventplanline
GROUP BY planno;

7.	
SELECT eventrequest.eventno, dateheld, COUNT(*) "Number of Plans"
FROM eventrequest, eventplan
WHERE eventplan.workdate BETWEEN to_date('12/1/2013','mm/dd/yyyy') AND to_date('12/31/2013','mm/dd/yyyy')
      AND eventrequest.eventno = eventplan.eventno
GROUP BY eventrequest.eventno, dateheld
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

SELECT eventrequest.eventno, dateheld, COUNT(*) "Number of Plans"
FROM eventrequest INNER JOIN eventplan ON eventrequest.eventno = eventplan.eventno
WHERE eventplan.workdate BETWEEN to_date('12/1/2013','mm/dd/yyyy') AND to_date('12/31/2013','mm/dd/yyyy')
GROUP BY eventrequest.eventno, dateheld
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

8.

SELECT eventplan.planno, eventrequest.eventno, workdate, activity
FROM eventrequest, eventplan, facility
WHERE eventplan.workdate BETWEEN to_date('12/1/2013','mm/dd/yyyy') AND to_date('12/31/2013','mm/dd/yyyy')
      AND eventrequest.eventno = eventplan.eventno 
      AND eventrequest.facno = facility.facno
      AND facname = 'Basketball arena';

SELECT eventplan.planno, eventrequest.eventno, workdate, activity
FROM ( eventrequest INNER JOIN eventplan 
                  ON eventrequest.eventno = eventplan.eventno ) 
               INNER JOIN Facility ON eventrequest.facno = facility.facno
WHERE eventplan.workdate BETWEEN to_date('12/1/2013','mm/dd/yyyy') AND to_date('12/31/2013','mm/dd/yyyy')
      AND facname = 'Basketball arena';

SELECT eventplan.planno, eventrequest.eventno, workdate, activity
FROM eventrequest, eventplan
WHERE eventplan.workdate BETWEEN to_date('12/1/2013','mm/dd/yyyy') AND to_date('12/31/2013','mm/dd/yyyy')
      AND eventrequest.eventno = eventplan.eventno 
      AND facno IN
          ( SELECT facno FROM facility WHERE facname = 'Basketball arena' );

SELECT eventrequest.eventno, dateheld, status, estcost
FROM eventrequest, employee, facility, eventplan
WHERE dateheld BETWEEN to_date('10/1/2013','mm/dd/yyyy') AND to_date('12/31/2013','mm/dd/yyyy')
      AND eventplan.empno = employee.empno AND eventrequest.facno = facility.facno
      AND facname = 'Basketball arena' AND empname = 'Mary Manager'
      AND eventrequest.eventno = eventplan.eventno;

SELECT eventrequest.eventno, dateheld, status, estcost
FROM ( ( eventrequest INNER JOIN eventplan 
                  ON eventrequest.eventno = eventplan.eventno ) 
               INNER JOIN Facility ON eventrequest.facno = facility.facno )
               INNER JOIN employee ON eventplan.empno = employee.empno
WHERE dateheld BETWEEN to_date('10/1/2013','mm/dd/yyyy') AND to_date('12/31/2013','mm/dd/yyyy')
      AND facname = 'Basketball arena' AND empname = 'Mary Manager';

SELECT eventrequest.eventno, dateheld, status, estcost
FROM eventrequest, eventplan
WHERE dateheld BETWEEN to_date('10/1/2013','mm/dd/yyyy') AND to_date('12/31/2013','mm/dd/yyyy')
      AND eventrequest.eventno = eventplan.eventno 
      AND facno IN
          ( SELECT facno FROM facility WHERE facname = 'Basketball arena' )
      AND empno IN
          ( SELECT empno FROM employee WHERE empname = 'Mary Manager' );

10.	The first solution is preferred because it involves one less table. However, I will also give credit for the second answer as it involves different join operations.

SELECT eventplan.planno, lineno, locname, resname, numberfld, 
                timestart, timeend
FROM facility, eventplan, eventplanline, resourcetbl, location
WHERE eventplan.workdate BETWEEN to_date('10/1/2013','mm/dd/yyyy') AND to_date('12/31/2013','mm/dd/yyyy')
      AND eventplan.planno = eventplanline.planno AND location.facno = facility.facno
      AND facname = 'Basketball arena' AND eventplanline.resno = resourcetbl.resno
      AND location.locno = eventplanline.locno 
      AND eventplan.activity = 'Operation';

SELECT eventplan.planno, lineno, locname, resname, numberfld, timestart, timeend
FROM eventrequest, facility, eventplan, eventplanline, resourcetbl, location
WHERE eventplan.workdate BETWEEN to_date('10/1/2013','mm/dd/yyyy') AND to_date('12/31/2013','mm/dd/yyyy')
      AND eventplan.planno = eventplanline.planno AND eventrequest.facno = facility.facno
      AND facname = 'Basketball arena' AND eventplanline.resno = resourcetbl.resno
      AND eventrequest.eventno = eventplan.eventno 
      AND location.locno = eventplanline.locno 
      AND eventplan.activity = 'Operation';


Database Modification Answers

1.	
INSERT INTO Facility ( FacNo, FacName )
VALUES ('F107', 'Swimming Pool');

2.	
INSERT INTO Location ( LocNo, FacNo, LocName )
VALUES ('L107', 'F107', 'Door');

3.	
INSERT INTO Location ( LocNo, FacNo, LocName )
VALUES ('L108', 'F107', 'Locker Room');

4.	
UPDATE Location SET LocName = ‘Gate’
WHERE LocNo = 'L107';
